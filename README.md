RAV
===

Creates new sound samples based on random shards of a source sound.  The shards are random sections of the original song,
and their length is specified by the user.  The shard length can also vary randomly within a specified range.

This application is useful for creating interesting ambient sounds or purely random solos.  Providing RAV with a sound sample containing just the notes of a chord or the notes of a scale will produce interesting results.  Try varying the lengths of the notes in the original sample!  Since the algorithm is completely random, distributing probabilities among the notes differently will affect the end result.  Also, try running your mix through RAV multiple times.

Both wav and mp3 formats are supported.  The sound file returned will be in mp3 format.
